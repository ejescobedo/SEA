<p>The purpose of the SEA application is to standarized the scanning and enumeration process. 
The team Code X created this application with the functions of storing Scan options and dependencies, Run
configuration, tool output, help menu and XML file creation. Instructions on how to initialize the 
application will be given next. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The SEA application makes use of MongoDB NoSQL database for the storing of information. Said information
if the Scan configuration, Run configuration, and XML report information. The SEA application makes use
of a free cluster in MongoDB to globally store the SEA application information. In order to connect to this
cluster, it is necessary to download the free MongoDB Compass application. Once installed, the user can 
click on the connect button and enter the following string "mongodb+srv://Admin:maps1010@sea.pz2g0.mongodb.net/test"
to connect to the global cluster, or can decide to run it locally by connecting clicking on connect and 
entering the string "localhost:27017". Currently, the application is to be connected locally in the code, if
the user wishes to connect to the global cluster, it is necessary to only uncomment line 81 of the code and
comment out line 82 of the code. After that, the application can be freely.
